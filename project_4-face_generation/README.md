# Face Generation

## Project Overview

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of celebrity faces (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA))[http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html]. The goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate _new_ images of faces that look as realistic as possible. The image below shows some images generated by the model:

## Project Instruction

### Instruction

1. Clone the repository and navigage to the downloaded folder.
	```
		git clone https://github.com/HROlive/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/project_4-face_generation
		cd project_4-face_generation
	```
2. Open the `dlnd_face_generation.ipynb` file.
	```
		jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
	```
3. Read and follow the instructions! This repository does not include the dataset of faces. You can find and download it in the notebook.

### Accelerating the Training Process

It's recommended to use a GPU to train the DCGAN. You can either use your local GPU(if you have access to one) or to use a service like Google Colab or an EC2 GPU instance(this costs money!) from Amazon Web Services.
